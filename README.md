üìö Vocabulary Flash Cards AppMastering new vocabulary just got easier and smarter! The Vocabulary Flash Cards App is a simple web application designed to help you learn and practice new words, track your pronunciation efforts, and identify challenging words using a visual Pareto chart.(Consider replacing this placeholder with an actual screenshot of your running app!)‚ú® FeaturesCSV Upload: Easily import new vocabulary lists from CSV files.Database Management: Add, edit, and delete words directly from the UI.Interactive Flashcard Test: Practice words and self-assess your pronunciation.Pronunciation Tracking: Keep count of correct and incorrect attempts for each word.Overall Statistics: View your total correct/incorrect counts and overall accuracy.Failure Frequency Chart (Pareto Chart): Visualize words you struggle with most, helping you focus your study efforts.Dockerized Deployment: Ready to run anywhere with Docker!üöÄ Getting StartedThis guide will help you get the Vocabulary Flash Cards App up and running on your local machine using Docker.1. Prerequisites: Install DockerFirst, you need to have Docker installed on your system. Follow the official Docker installation guide for your operating system:Windows: Install Docker Desktop on WindowsmacOS: Install Docker Desktop on MacLinux: Install Docker Engine on Linux (Choose your specific distribution, e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS).Make sure Docker is running after installation. You can verify by opening a terminal and typing:docker --version
docker compose version # If you plan to use docker compose later
2. Pull the Docker ImageOnce Docker is installed and running, you can pull the pre-built application image from Docker Hub.Replace YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME with your actual Docker Hub username:docker pull YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME/vocabulary-flashcards-app:latest
3. Create and Run the Docker ContainerTo run the application and ensure your vocabulary data persists even if the container is stopped or removed, we will use a Docker volume mount.First, navigate to the directory where you want to store your application's data (e.g., your preferred projects folder). Create a subdirectory named data in this location if it doesn't exist already:# Example: Create a project directory and then a data subdirectory
mkdir vocabulary-app-data
cd vocabulary-app-data
mkdir data
Now, from the vocabulary-app-data directory (or wherever you want your data folder to be), run the following command to create and start your Docker container:docker run -p 5000:5000 -v "$(pwd)/data:/app/data" YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME/vocabulary-flashcards-app:latest
-p 5000:5000: Maps port 5000 on your computer to port 5000 inside the Docker container.-v "$(pwd)/data:/app/data": This is crucial! It mounts your host machine's ./data directory (relative to where you run the command) to the /app/data directory inside the container. This means:Your vocabulary.db SQLite database will be stored in your local data folder.Any words you upload or statistics you generate will be saved on your local machine and persist across container restarts.4. Use the AppOnce the Docker container is running, open your web browser and navigate to:http://localhost:5000/You should see the Vocabulary Flash Cards App!Watch a quick demo on how to use the app:(Replace YOUR_VIDEO_ID with your YouTube video ID and YOUR_VIDEO_LINK with the actual URL to your demo video.)ü§ù ContributingContributions, issues, and feature requests are welcome!
